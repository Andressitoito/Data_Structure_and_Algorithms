## Introduction

This repository is meant to provide a practical introduction to data structures and algorithms in JavaScript. It includes example implementations of common data structures and algorithms, as well as exercises and challenges to help you practice and deepen your understanding.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this repository, you should have a basic understanding of JavaScript and programming concepts such as variables, functions, loops, and arrays.

## Data Structures

This repository includes examples and implementations of various data structures, such as:

### Arrays

Arrays are a basic Data Structure used to store a collection of values. They are used to implement many other Data Structures such as Stacks, Queues, and Trees. In this section, we will cover basic array operations such as accessing, searching, and sorting.

### Linked Lists

Linked Lists are a Data Structure used to store a collection of values that are connected through links. They are used to implement many other Data Structures such as Queues and Trees. In this section, we will cover basic Linked List operations such as adding, removing, and traversing.

### Stacks

Stacks are a Data Structure used to store a collection of values that follow the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. They are commonly used for undo operations and for evaluating expressions. In this section, we will cover basic Stack operations such as push, pop, and peek.

### Queues

Queues are a Data Structure used to store a collection of values that follow the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. They are commonly used in scheduling and resource allocation systems. In this section, we will cover basic Queue operations such as enqueue, dequeue, and peek.

### Trees

Trees are a Data Structure used to store hierarchical data. They are used to implement many other Data Structures such as Binary Search Trees and Heaps. In this section, we will cover basic Tree operations such as adding, removing, and traversing.

### Graphs

Graphs are a Data Structure used to store a collection of nodes and their connections. They are used to model many real-world systems such as social networks and transportation networks. In this section, we will cover basic Graph operations such as adding nodes and edges, removing nodes and edges, and traversing.

## Algorithms

This repository also includes examples and implementations of various algorithms, such as:

- Sorting algorithms (e.g. Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Searching algorithms (e.g. Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Recursion
- Graph Traversal

Each algorithm is accompanied by examples and exercises to help you understand how it works and how to use it.
